                <div class="grid">
                    <p>
                        I am a skilled software developer with experience in Java, JavaScript, and C#. I have worked with a variety of frameworks, including ASP .Net, ASP .Net Core, Bootstrap, and Spring-Boot. Additionally, I have experience working with SQL, MySQL, MongoDB, and React JS libraries. I have used Git and GitLab, and I am familiar with the Agile Scrum methodology. I have also worked with Jira as a work manager and Gradle as a project builder. Troubleshooting technical issues is also a strength of mine, and I am comfortable working in fast-paced environments with multiple technologies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition to my technical skills, I also have experience working as an account manager. In this role, I was responsible for contacting vendors to resolve issues and obtain necessary invoices. I kept track of all account-related activities and corrected any issues with incorrect or missing invoices. I also communicated daily with the team responsible for advertising campaigns and was part of the automation team, where I helped create tools to automate repetitive tasks in the department. My experience in software development and account management has given me more skills that I believe will be an asset to any team.
